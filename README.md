## Welcome to Membergrid! ðŸ¥³
#### ðŸš§ We are undergoing a migration to Next13! A new, publicly-available repository will be available soon ðŸš§

Please note: This is a work in progress. Please do not share or distribute this material.

Membergrid brings an accessible user interface to your organization's member database.  
Instead of crawling through overwhelming spreadsheets, Membergrid makes it easy to  
search, connect, and visualize your team!
